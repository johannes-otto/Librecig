# Ratte Base
The goal with this series of Mods is to build a versatile, easy to assemble mod. It's supposed to be easily printable, even on cheap printers.

Currently this platform offers the following battery configurations:
- 2x 18650 -> [Die Ratte](https://github.com/johannes-otto/Librecig/blob/master/Ratte%20and%20Variations/Ratte/Readme.md)
- 4x 18650 -> [Der Leviathan](https://github.com/johannes-otto/Librecig/blob/master/Ratte%20and%20Variations/Leviatan/Readme.md)
- 6x 18650 ->  [Der Wisent](https://github.com/johannes-otto/Librecig/blob/master/Ratte%20and%20Variations/Wisent/Readme.md)

The Front Panel is variable, too. You can choose between the following electronics:
- BigAl's ANT 6s
- BigAl's iPWM 6s
- A simple VM+Mosfet with a Master switch (If you're on the cheap)

New electronics might be added as I use them. But you can easily redesign a front panel for a specific board. For example a Yihi SX350 works. But you have to keep in mind that regulated boards are boring ;-).

The Side Panel is slideable, although I nearly only squonk, you can choose between the following panels:
- Blank for your Tanks/normal Drippers
- Squonk
- Top-Feed (As with the DripEZ -> The concept works way better than you might think)
