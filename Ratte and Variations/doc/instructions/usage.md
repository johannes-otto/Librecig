# Usage Instructions

## The Wisent is not safe
The Wisent is dangerous in any way. You shouldn't use it.

## Battery venting
As you might have noticed, the mods don't have any venting holes. This is ok for me, since the mods are not air tight.

## Mind your resistance
Building too low, especially on high voltage mods, may damage your batteries and may toast your electronics, too. BigAl's ANT board is
recommended for max 40A, the iPWM is recommended for 60A. You might check [bigalsmods](https://bigalsmods.com) for further information.
Anyway it's better to stay within the limits of your batteries. A good Sony VTC5A can deliver 30A.
For the minimum resistance, calculate with the fully charged voltage of your battery. The formula is:
number_of_batteries * 4.2 / max_battery_amps

Ratte:
2 * 4.2 / 30 = 0.28

Leviathan
4 * 4.2 / 30 = 0.56

Wisent
6 * 4.2 / 30 = 0.84

## Water
The mods are not waterproof. Using the mod in the rain for a few minutes was never a problem for me, but I wouldn't leave it in the rain.

## Refilling the squonk bottle
Just unscrew the bottle put your new juice in and screw it back on. It will leak a bit while the bottle is off, but I don't give a fk.
