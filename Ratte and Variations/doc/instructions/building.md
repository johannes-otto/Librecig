# Building Ratte / Wisent / Leviathan

## Chosing the Model
I highly recommend to build "Die Ratte" first. "Die Ratte" is build many times by me and I'm vaping it for months daily. "Der Leviathan"
and "Der Wisent" are just interesting side projects and still need some work (although the do vape, but they are not perfect).

## Checking the printed parts
Before you start any soldering, you should check the printed parts. Many printers suffer dimensional inaccuracy. Start with measuring. Then start sticking the parts together, check the gaps.
The bottom door needs to slide firmly into the body. It should't be loose, but it also shouldn't require much force to slide it in. If you use too much force, you might break the body.
If the part fits too tight, you can use a knife to scrape off acess material.
If you want you can put in the screws to check if everything looks as expected.

## Manufacturing the contact plates
First we need 2 terminals where the cables coming from the board and the 510 are
beeing soldered to.
Cut a small piece of brass and drill a 3.2mm hole in it. The terminal doesnt need
to be bigger than the M3 nut. On one side, leave some space for the cable as
seen in the picture.

Next thing we need are bridges. For a dual 18650 you need one, for 4x18650 you
need 3 and for 6x18650 you need 5.
Drill 2 3.2mm holes into a brass plate. They must be 19mm apart. Then cut out the
plate. It doesn't need to be wider than the M3 nut.

## Electronics
In this example we use an iPWM board:

If you got the another front plate and the components, you may use one of these diagrams:

- [Mosfet Wire Diagram]()

In any case. I use to cut the contacts of the button to save space. I usually leave about a mm. Also I cut the mount holes of the voltmeter. Be sure to have the button screwed in tightly. Bad things happen if the nut becomes loose an starts traveling inside your mod.
Don't glue in the components yet. I recommend not doing that before you verified that your soldering works.

## Connecting the Battery contacs
Solder the wires from the board and the 510 directly to the pole contacts.
You need a powerful soldering iron to get enough heat into the brass.

## Screwing in the 510
Use the 510 tightening tool to tighten the 510. Tighten it firmly to avoid
the 510 becoming loose while screwing/unscrewing the atomizer.

## Pre flight check
Use a pliers or something metallic to bridge the first two batteries.
You should see the mod turn on. If something strange happens, instantly pull away
the pliers.
If everything is working as it should, you can glue in the voltmeter and the pot now. I recommend just using a few drops of superglue. If you use too much, disassembling would be a pain.

## Optional: Preparing the squonk plate
Press the cap of the squonk bottle into the hole from the squonk plate. Don't press
it in too far, since the bottle wouldn't be sealed when not beeing screwed in far
enough. Leave the tube a bit longer. Now cut the tube on the bottom in the
bottle. Leave some 1mm space between the end of the tube and the bottom of The
bottle to let the liquid flow during the squonk action.

## Final Assembly
[image tightened top]()
Tighten the screws of the top part.

Optional: Insert the squonk plate
Now take some pliers again. Angled pliers are suited best for this part. Cut
the top part of the tube to length. and push the tube over the pin of the 510.
Don't leave the tube too long as it might block the liquid flow. Leave the bottle hanging to
the side of the mod.
While screwing in the screws of the front plate, you carefully hold the part in
Place.
After you put in a few screws, test if the connection is tight and the flow isn't blocked.
To do that, you can unscrew the bottle and carefully blow through the tube.


Put in some insulation between the switch and the 510
Now screw in the rest of the screws. Don't overtighten them. You are dealing with
plastics.

## Final check
Before you push in the battery door, check the function of the board again
with the pliers test we did earlier.

## Insert Batteries
When inserting the batteries, know your polarity. If you use the wisent, be sure to have the battery screws loose before inserting or removing the battery door. Otherwise you WILL short 4 batteries at the same time while the door jams!
Take your time when adjusting the contacts for the first time. You don't need much tension for the batteries to contact, but it's tricky on the wisent or the leviathan to get them all contact at the same time. If you overtighten the screws, you might break the mod.
