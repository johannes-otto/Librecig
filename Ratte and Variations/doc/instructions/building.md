# Building Ratte / Wisent / Leviathan

## Checking the printed parts
Before you start any soldering, you should check the printed parts. Many printers suffer dimensional inaccuracy. Start with measuring. Then start sticking the parts together, check the gaps.
The bottom door needs to slide firmly into the body. It should't be loose, but it also shouldn't require much force to slide it in. If you use too much force, you might break the body.
If the part fits too tight, you can use a knife to scrape off acess material.
If you want you can put in the screws to check if everything looks as expected.
