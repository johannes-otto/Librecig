# Printing the parts

## Materials
The following Materials are recommended.

1. PETG
[PETG]
  + Easy to print
  + Mechanical durable
  + Available in many (translucent) Colors
  - Stringing
  
2. Carbonfill
[Carbonfill]
  + Rough, matt surface
  + Mechanical Durable
  - Only black
  - Messy to print
  - Tends to clog nozzles
  - Need a hardened / plated nozzle
 
3. ABS / ASA
[Image ABS]
  + Mechanical durable
  + High temperature resistance
  + Available in many colors
  - Smells while printing
  - Harder to print
  - Need an enclusure to print
  
 PETG and Carbonfill resist about 80-100°C. This usually is enough, even for leaving the mod in the car during summer.
 ABS can withstand 100-120°C, but I wouldn't consider the worse printability worth it.
