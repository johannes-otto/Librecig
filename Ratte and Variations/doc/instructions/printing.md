# Printing the parts

## Materials
The following Materials are recommended.

1. PETG
![](https://www.formfutura.com/web/image/product.template/248/image/300x300?unique=7e0ae0c)
  + Easy to print
  + Mechanical durable
  + Available in many (translucent) Colors
  - Stringing
  
2. Carbonfill
![](https://www.formfutura.com/web/image/product.template/158/image/300x300?unique=7e0ae0c)
  + Rough, matt surface
  + Mechanical Durable
  - Only black
  - Messy to print
  - Tends to clog nozzles
  - Need a hardened / plated nozzle
 
3. ABS / ASA

  + Mechanical durable
  + High temperature resistance
  + Available in many colors
  - Smells while printing
  - Harder to print
  - Need an enclusure to print
  
 PETG and Carbonfill resist about 80-100°C. This usually is enough, even for leaving the mod in the car during summer.
 ABS can withstand 100-120°C, but I wouldn't consider the worse printability worth it.
 
 
 ## Supports
 ### Body
 Support the overhangs and the slot for the battery door. You shouldn't put supports into the screw holes, as they are difficult to remove.

 ### Battery Cover
 The fit of the door is pretty tight. So it's recommended to support the overhang here.

 ### Squonk / Top Feed Plate
 Put some supports inside to support the top of the bottle holder. Don't use too many.
