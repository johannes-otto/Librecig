# Eichörnchen
This mod is a redesign from scratch based on the ideas and experiences of "die Ratte". The mod is pretty compact and uses 21700s. 
The exchangeable side panels have been dropped since I found myself squonking all the time anyway. I might design a non-squonk variation
at some point if I come across a tank that really blows me away.

## Parts you need
- Obviously the printed parts. I recommend to use PETG
- 25mm Squonk 510 ([MM150](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Mod-Making-Supplies/Squonk-Parts/MM510-Squonker-Connector))
- [BigAls iPWM](http://www.bigalsmods.com/Big-Als-Intelligent-PWM-iPWM-2s-6s-wpot_p_12.html)
- Squonk bottle, the design is made for the squonk bottle by [ModMaker](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Mod-Making-Supplies/Squonk-Parts/MM-Squonker-Bottle-Kit). You can use others, but the mod is designed to fit this. If you want to use another, open an issue here and I will alter the design for you.
- Some extra tubing - about 5cm from the top of the bottle to the 510
- Mitec Switch 12mm
- 0.28" Voltmeter
- 2x M3 screws with nuts for the bottom contact bridge
- A piece of brass or copper for the bottom contact bridge
- Tiny Screws I use [Din 1.5x6](https://minischrauben.com/blech-holzschrauben-linsenkopf--44900.html). You can use others. The holes are 1.5mm x 6mm
- [Keystone 209](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Keystone-209-Battery-Contact-Clips-x-4?search=keystone) Clips for the top contacts

## Tips and Tricks
- Put a strip of Tesa on the top of the voltmeter. It acts as a screen protector and helps to seal it.
- Cut down the legs of the switch. They don't need to be that long and may contact the 510 otherwise.
- Wait for the glue to be really dry ;-)
- Don't use overly thick cables, you don't have much extra space. I use 1.5mm²
- Don't use too long cables or it might not fit
