# Eich√∂rnchen
This mod is a redesign from scratch based on the ideas and experiences of "die Ratte". The mod is pretty compact and uses 21700s. 
The exchangeable side panels have been dropped since I found myself squonking all the time anyway. I might design a non-squonk variation
at some point if I come across a tank that really blows me away.
