# Build Instructions - "Das Eichh√∂rnchen"

## Warning and intentions
This document should help you to put together this mod. However, this may just serve as a documentary how I do it. I'm not a trained electrician or have any professional authority in this buisiness. If you build your mod, you take the responsibility for it. Things that might happen to electronic cigarettes when misused or improperly assembled:
- Explosions
- Fire
- unhealthy Smoke
- Kittens may die
If you are unsure about electronics or building mods, you shouldn't continue.
I don't provide wiring diagrams. Get them from the manufacturer of your board.

##Again! Lithium-Ion Batterys are little bombs that wait to explode due to improper treatment!!


## Parts you need
- Obviously the printed parts. PETG works fine for me.
- 25mm Squonk 510 ([MM150](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Mod-Making-Supplies/Squonk-Parts/MM510-Squonker-Connector))
- [BigAls iPWM](http://www.bigalsmods.com/Big-Als-Intelligent-PWM-iPWM-2s-6s-wpot_p_12.html)
- Squonk bottle, the design is made for the squonk bottle by [ModMaker](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Mod-Making-Supplies/Squonk-Parts/MM-Squonker-Bottle-Kit). Alternatively there is a silicone bottle available by [ModMaker](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Mod-Making-Supplies/Squonk-Parts/MM-Dinky-Silicone-Squonker-Bottle-Kit-Light). You can use others, but the mod is designed to fit this. If you want to use another, open an issue here and I will alter the design for you.
- Some extra tubing - about 5cm from the top of the bottle to the 510
- Mitec Switch 12mm
- 0.28" Voltmeter
- 2x M3 screws with nuts for the bottom contact bridge
- A piece of brass or copper for the bottom contact bridge
- 30x Tiny Screws. I use [Din 1.5x6](https://minischrauben.com/blech-holzschrauben-linsenkopf--44900.html). You can use others. The holes are 1.5mm x 6mm
- [Keystone 209](http://www.modmaker.co.uk/Keystone-209-Battery-Contact-Clips-x-4?search=keystone) Clips for the top contacts


## Build Process

Start by inspecting the printed parts. The parts should fit together nicely and there shouldn't be gaps.

Put two strips of TESA on the display of your Voltmeter to protect it from liquid damage

Then glue it into the top part. Make sure it sits really well. You can't correct it later on. Also don't use excessive amounts of glue.

Screw the Mitec switch into the front panel. Make sure it sits tight. If the Nut comes loose inside your mod, it might short out. Also cut down the leads of the switch and put some solder on it.

Glue the pot with the board into the front panel. Make sure it sits correct and flush.

!!Be sure to let the glue dry completely before continuing. Otherwise the board and the voltmeter might move during assembly!!

Prepare the battery door. In this case the bridge looks really janky and wrong, cause I recycled a piece I had lying arround. The correct way is:
- Drill 2 holes into a piece of brass/copper. The holes should be 22mm apart. You might use the holes in the battery door as template.
- Cut the acess metal, so the bridge fits inside the battery door.
- Put the M3 nuts into the holes and screw in the bridge.
- Cut or file down the screws so that they don't stick out of the bottom
