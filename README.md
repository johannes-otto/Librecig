Want to vape hard? Want to vape free?

## Disclaimer
Neither I nor any of the contributors of this project are reponsible for anything that might happen to you with self build mods. Lithium-Ion batteries are dangerous when handled incorrectly and can seriously harm you. If you build one of these mods, you take the responsibility for yourself. Also I'm not an electrical engineer. My designs work for me, but that doesn't mean that they are safe in any way.

## Please don't sell these designs
All this stuff is released under GPL V3.It should be free for anyone wanting to build his own mod.

## What this is about
I started my first build due to paranoia of the European TPD laws. I have a certain style of vaping and I don't want the government to tell me what to vape and what not.
Also I was annoyed that my favorite mods break after a year or two of constant usage and that I can't buy spare parts to repair them.

Since then building and 3D printing mods has become a passion of mine. I did countless iterations and now I think the designs reached
enough maturity to be released.That doesn't mean that this is the end. I'm constantly improving my designs and from time to time I try something completely new.
The plan is to share everything.
I hope that other modders are willing to contribute, so that we could build a free repository of mods for "Maker-Vapers".
